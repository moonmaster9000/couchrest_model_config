v0.1.2
  -- CouchRest inheritable attribute override gone. simpler method for fixing rails reloading problem.

v0.1.1
  -- overrode the CouchRest inheritable attributes code to only create the inheritable attributes
     if they don't already exist. Should hopefully solve a problem that crops up in development mode in 
     rails when trying to override an attribute accessor/writer method created with this.

v0.1.0
  -- `use_database` no longer supported when using CouchRest::Model::Config

v0.0.2
  -- alias_method_chain both the class and instance `database` methods 
     on CouchRest::Model::Base
